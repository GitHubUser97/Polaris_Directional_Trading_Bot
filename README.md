A Cryptocurrency Trading Bot, it Applies Dr. Elder's Triple Screen trading concept in an automated framework. This bot uses Machine Learning to detect trends and standard market indicators (volatility, exponential moving averages and Stochastic Oscilator) to post trades.

This Bot Uses a deprecated version of Poloniex API, altough the strategy is operational, its ETL/trading commands needs refactoring.
